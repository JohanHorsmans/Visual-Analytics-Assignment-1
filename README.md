# Visual Analytics Assignment 1:

Hello,

To assess my assignment you should download the .ipynb-script in this repository. This can be done manually by going through the following steps:

1: Open the "word_counts.ipynb" file in this repository.

2: Press "raw" in the top right corner.

3: Save the file as an .ipynb-file (windows: ctrl + s // mac: cmd + s).

4: Upload this to your "src" or "notebooks" folder in Jupyter notebook.

5: Download the "doomcrossing"-folder from this repository and clone it to "/cds-visual/data" where you should create a new folder titled "doomcrossing".

6: Open the script and run it.
